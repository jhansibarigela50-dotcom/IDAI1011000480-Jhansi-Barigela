**Overview**

This NutriWell chatbot aids people in building up their wellness through fitness guidance and tracking. The senario this follows is that of an employee in a health and wellness company that aims to build an intelligent chatbot using their internal AI development team. Through the use of intents and entities the chatbot is able to create a customized dietary plan based on food restrictions, reccomend an approporiate meal plan, and give fitness and hydration reminders. The intents help the conversation flow while the entities allow inputs of unique responses.

**Intents** 

* Welcome Intent – Greets the user and asks for their name to start the conversation.

* Name Intent – Captures the user’s name using an “any” entity and responds personally.

* Age Intent – Asks for and records the user’s age with a numeric entity.

* Weight Intent – Collects the user’s weight, including units (kg/lbs), to personalize fitness plans.

* Fitness Goal Intent – Asks about the user’s main fitness goal, such as losing weight or gaining muscle.

* Goal Type Intent – Interprets different ways users express their fitness goals using synonyms.

* Diet Preference Intent – Identifies the user’s preferred diet type (e.g., keto, vegetarian, pescatarian).

* Cooking Time Intent – Gathers how much time the user has for cooking (short, medium, or long).

* Budget Intent – Determines the user’s food budget level (low, medium, or high).

* Dietary Restriction Intent – Asks for any allergies or food restrictions the user may have.

* No Dietary Restriction Intent – Handles users with no food restrictions and proceeds to meal recommendations.

* Meal Plan Recommendation Intent – Provides a personalized meal plan based on all collected data.

* Hydration Tracking Offer Intent – Asks the user if they’d like to track their daily water intake.

* Hydration Reminder Intent – Records how many hydration reminders the user would like per day.

* Exercise Reminder Offer Intent – Asks the user if they’d like to receive exercise reminders.

* Exercise Reminder Frequency Intent – Collects how many times per week the user wants workout reminders.

**This chatbot can be integrated into users' daily lives not only as an advisor for information but also as a motivational assistant, guiding them through every step on their wellness journey.**

**To deploy the bot, I used Dialogflow's internal messaging system (Dialogflow Messenger) which I also utilized during the stages of testing and error-checking to ensure that my bot can handle a variety of situations and dilemmas with users from all walks of life.**
